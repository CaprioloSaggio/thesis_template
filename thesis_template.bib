	abstract = {Most current Artificial Neural Network ({ANN}) models are based on highly simplified brain dynamics. They have been used as powerful computational tools to solve complex pattern recognition, function estimation, and classification problems. {ANNs} have been evolving towards more powerful and more biologically realistic models. In the past decade, Spiking Neural Networks ({SNNs}) have been developed which comprise of spiking neurons. Information transfer in these neurons mimics the information transfer in biological neurons, i.e., via the precise timing of spikes or a sequence of spikes. To facilitate learning in such networks, new learning algorithms based on varying degrees of biological plausibility have also been developed recently. Addition of the temporal dimension for information encoding in {SNNs} yields new insight into the dynamics of the human brain and could result in compact representations of large neural networks. As such, {SNNs} have great potential for solving complicated time-dependent pattern recognition problems because of their inherent dynamic representation. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of the development of spiking neurons and {SNNs}, and provides insight into their evolution as the third generation neural networks.},

            The advent of multimodal brain atlases promises to accelerate discoveries in neuroscience by offering in silico queries of cell types, connectivity and gene expression in regions of interest. We employed multiplexed fluorescent in situ {RNA} hybridization chain reaction ({HCR}) to generate expression maps for an initial set of 200 marker genes across the larval zebrafish brain. The data were registered to the Max Planck Zebrafish Brain (mapzebrain) atlas, thus allowing co-visualization of gene expression patterns, single-neuron tracings, transgenic lines and anatomical segmentations. Additionally, brain activity maps of freely swimming larvae were generated at single-cell resolution using {HCR} labeling of the immediate-early gene 
            cfos 
            and integrated into the atlas. As a proof of concept, we identified a novel class of cerebellar eurydendroid cells that express 
            calb2a 
            , project to the hypothalamus and are activated in animals that have recently ingested food. Thus, a cellular-resolution gene expression atlas will not only help with rapid identification of marker genes for neuronal populations of interest, but also bridge the molecular and circuit levels by anchoring genetic information to functional activity maps and synaptic connectivity.},

	abstract = {Shortly after larval zebraﬁsh become free swimming their behavior is modulated by both autochthonous signals and external stimuli. Larvae show rapid responses to a range of sensory cues but are also capable of executing extended behavioral programs in response to changes in the environment. At this early stage, larvae have a small repertoire of discrete stereotyped movements which are deployed in different contexts to generate appropriate behavior. We outline the range of behaviors deﬁned in zebraﬁsh larvae to date and discuss insights into neural function revealed by behavioral assays. A growing body of work demonstrates that tractability of behavior and neural connectivity in larval zebraﬁsh facilitate the analysis of neural pathways underlying vertebrate motor control and sensory processing.},

	abstract = {Neural processing occurs across a range of temporal scales. To facilitate this, the brain uses fast-changing representations reflecting momentary sensory input alongside more temporally extended representations, which integrate across both short and long temporal windows. The temporal flexibility of these representations allows animals to behave adaptively. Short temporal windows facilitate adaptive responding in dynamic environments, while longer temporal windows promote the gradual integration of information across time. In the cognitive and motor domains, the brain sets overarching goals to be achieved within a long temporal window, which must be broken down into sequences of actions and precise movement control processed across much shorter temporal windows. Previous human neuroimaging studies and large-scale artificial network models have ascribed different processing timescales to different cortical regions, linking this to each region’s position in an anatomical hierarchy determined by patterns of inter-regional connectivity. However, even within cortical regions, there is variability in responses when studied with single-neuron electrophysiology. Here, we review a series of recent electrophysiology experiments that demonstrate the heterogeneity of temporal receptive fields at the level of single neurons within a cortical region. This heterogeneity appears functionally relevant for the computations that neurons perform during decision-making and working memory. We consider anatomical and biophysical mechanisms that may give rise to a heterogeneity of timescales, including recurrent connectivity, cortical layer distribution, and neurotransmitter receptor expression. Finally, we reflect on the computational relevance of each brain region possessing a heterogeneity of neuronal timescales. We argue that this architecture is of particular importance for sensory, motor, and cognitive computations.},
